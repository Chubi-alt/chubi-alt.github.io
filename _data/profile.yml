    I am a master student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), pursuing a Master of Computing in Computer Science. Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)
    My research interests primarily focus on Multimodal LLMs, Generalist GUI Agents, and Autonomous Driving.
    Currently, I am highly motivated and actively seeking PhD opportunities for the upcoming intake, and I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in these fields.
    Outside of my academic pursuits, I am a passionate foodie🍔 and an avid gamer🎮.
